# 789 Schedule Widget

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- config.js (edit this file to change schedule)
- main.js

Quick start:
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Paste the `config.js` you already have into the project root.
3. Run Live Server or `python -m http.server` to test locally.
4. Commit and push to GitHub (repo: `789-schedule-widget`).
5. Optionally enable GitHub Pages to host `styles.css`, `config.js`, `main.js`.
6. Embed in Webador by linking the CSS and scripts from GitHub Pages or by inlining the HTML/CSS/JS.

Notes:
- Times in `config.js` are EST (`America/New_York`). Durations accept decimals (e.g., 1.5).
- Founders (Vibes/Wooki/Gator) are locked to the Zippo row.
- Update only `config.js` for schedule changes.
